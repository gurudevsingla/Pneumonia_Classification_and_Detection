# Business Problem:

- Pneumonia is a serious transmittable disease in India, It is responsible for high morbidity and mortality amongst children under five year of age. India accounts for one-third of the total WHO South East Asia burden of under-five mortality. (source: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6131850/).
- Chest X-rays are currently the best available method for diagnosing it.
- Suppose You are working as a Data Scientist at Qure.ai (a Medical startup) and want to Classify if a person has pneumonia or not.
  - You also have to deploy the model on mobile device for real time inferences

  - Please go through this link to know about the existing apps in medical domain :

- This was especially useful during the times when COVID-19 was known to cause pneumonia.

## Brief intro:

What is Pneumonia?

- Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs.
- The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.
- A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.

- Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening.
- It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.

### Real time constraints:
- Low latency requirements
- False negatives or positives can be risky
- Model should be confident in deciding the class
- Model explainability through visualizations

# Data

Dataset is present inside tensorflow.data.TFRecordDataset

# Approach

- State-of-the-art models like VGG16, InceptionNet, ResNet, EfficientNet etc.are computationally heavy and cannot be deployed on mobile devices.

- So we are going to use mobilenet
    - MobileNet achieves sky high accuracies and is 100x smaller compared to these models
    - MobileNet is used on mobile apps for object detection, image classficiation, etc. and provide low latency outputs for any use case.

- Finetuning MobineNetV2 for classifying images.
- There are way more images that are classified as pneumonia than normal in our dataset.
- This shows that we have an **imbalance** in our data i.e our model can be biased towards high majority class (Pneumonia in our case)

### **How we are going to solve the class imbalance here ?**

- Here Data augmentation will not be useful because X-ray scans are only taken in a specific orientation, and variations such as flips and rotations will not exist in real X-ray images.

- We will correct for this imbalance later using class weights.

### **Figuring out which part of the image our model focuses on to get a prediction ?**

* We, **as humans**, when we try to classify an image.
* **we look at certain region in the image to make our judgement**.
* **For eg:** In case of cats & dog classification, weâ€™ll focus on face of the animal in the picture.
* In this case, i.e. pneunomnia classification, **the domain expert or doctor look at the specific region of the xray in the frame**.

**How can we check what region in the image our CNN is focusing on ?**

* With the help of **GradCAM(Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map**) algorithm.
* It helps to find out the region on which **CNN is focusing on to predict particular class**.

- **Precision**: 0.7734693884849548
